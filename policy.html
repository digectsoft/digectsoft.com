                    <p  class="lead">Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, Analytics Information, Mobile Device Identifiers, and Interest-Based Advertising</p>
                    <p  class="lead">We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors’ device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Services that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Mobile Device Identifiers. We may share the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device or tablet (such as the Apple IDFA and Google Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only as permitted by Apple, and we use the Google Advertising ID only as permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy settings on your mobile device. In some cases, you may need to reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Analytics. We may also use Google Analytics to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Services by going to http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Our uses of such Technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Operationally Necessary. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functions such as shopping-carts, saved search, or similar functions;</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Performance Related. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Functionality Related. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Advertising or Targeting Related. We may use first party or third-party Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party digital properties.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising</p>
                    <p  class="lead">You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. To separately make choices for mobile apps on a mobile device, you can download the DAA’s AppChoices application from your device’s app store. In addition, for some devices you may use your device’s platform controls in your settings to exercise choice (e.g., Android, iOS, and others). You may also email us at ccpaoptout@jamcity.com and we will do our best to assist you with your request.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from data partners and other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/, https://youradchoices.ca/choices/, and www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Please note you must separately opt out in each browser and on each device. Advertisements on third party websites that contain the AdChoices link may have been directed to you based on information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">You can see the list of companies that may implement and/or access cookies and other technologies on your mobile device, and how to opt-out of such technologies (where available) at http://www.jamcity.com/adpartners/.</p>

Regardless of your marketing preferences, we may also send you certain non-promotional communications regarding us and our Services (e.g., communications regarding the Services or updates to this Privacy Policy).

We may also collect geolocation information if you use our mobile applications. To stop this, you may change the settings on your mobile device.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Third Party Websites/Applications and Software Development Kits</p>
                    <p  class="lead">The Services may contain links to other websites/applications and other websites/applications may reference or link to our Services.

We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">We may use third party APIs and software development kits (“SDKs”) as part of the functionality of our Services.

                    <p  class="lead">Data Sharing and Disclosure</p>

Nevertheless, in order to provide a more relevant advertising experience, we may allow third-party advertising partners to set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Services that collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, mobile identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). We may also combine and share such information and other information (such as demographic information and past purchase history) with our third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for the purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you in our games, or when you visit third-party websites or applications that use their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “personalized advertising.” If you prefer not to share your Personal Data with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions above in the section “Cookies and Interest- Based Advertising.”</p>

Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your “account ID”, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">International Transfer</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide Personal Data to us, DigectSoft will transfer your Personal Data to the United States and process it there in order to provide the Services. For such cases, we will contractually ensure that the protection level regarding your Personal Data is consistent with your home jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Retention Period</p>
                    <p  class="lead">We will store your Personal Data for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Children’s Privacy Policy</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Protecting children’s privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the user’s age. For these services, when a user indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, chat features, and certain types of notification alerts. We also limit Personal Data collection and sharing to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns regarding the service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us at privacy@jamcity.com. If we become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, we will delete any Personal Data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.</p>
                    <p  class="lead">Third Party Service Providers</p>
                    <p  class="lead">We use the following third party service providers in relation to children in our apps:</p>
